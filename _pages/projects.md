+ **Bachelor thesis:The effects of unconventional monetary policies by the European Central Bank on share returns**

This research investigates the effects of the announcements dates of the Long Term Refinancing Operations and Outright Monetary Transactions Program on share returns for Italian and German non-financial firms. Two out of three coefficients for the OMT program announcement dates and one out of two coefficients for the LTRO program announcement dates have a significant influence on share returns in Italy. Therefore this paper finds that there is no significant overal effect of the announcements on the returns of shares for Italian non-financial firms, whereby size of firms plays no role. The announcement dates of both programs have a positive significant influence on large German non-financial firms, 0.6% for the OMT announcements and 0.4% for the LTRO announcements.
