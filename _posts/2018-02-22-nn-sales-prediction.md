> This posts discusses my team's approach to the second week's challenge in the Bletchley Artificial Intelligence Bootcamp at Erasmus University Rotterdam. I will specifically discuss feature engineering and tweaking of the model, instead of discussing the data in detail.

### The Challenge
Based on historical data, this challenge requires the participants to predict sales for different departments across 45 Wallmart stores, on a weekly basis.
