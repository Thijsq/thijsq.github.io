### Supervised learning with scikit-learn 
I recently finished this exciting course by Datacamp.com, which covers the main aspects of supervised machine learning. 

In order to succesfully complete this
course prior knowledge on Python and statistics is required. Therefore I would recommend taking the introductory and intermediate Python courses first. 
If you are a student in a quantitative field you will most likely have covered the requried statistics at university. Otherwise the Statistical Thinking in Python will provide you will the necessary statistic foundation.

When working your way through the course don't refer to the slides too often. When stuck during an exercise try to Google your way out of it. This will allow you to find the necessary commands/coding in order to complete the exercise. The slides however will directly give you the answer, when doing this too often
you will most likely find yourself retyping lines instead of actually understanding what you are doing.

Make sure to post all your achieved certificates on LinkedIn.

To give you an idea of what a certificate issued by Datacamp.com looks like, you can find the certificate of this course [here](https://github.com/Thijsq/Datacamp/blob/raw/Supervised%20learning%20with%20scikit.pdf)
