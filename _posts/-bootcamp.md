> Past April I graduated from the Artifical Intelligence bootcamp by Bletchley|Turing Society, which was hosted for excelling students.


### The Bootcamp
The bootcamp was an intense 9-week program coering machine learning with an emphasis on deep learning.
The bootcamp aimed at applying state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to finance related topics. The bootcamp was organized in such a way that together with my groupmates
every week we had to solve a challenge. From the beginning we participated in Kaggle competitions against some of the most advanced machine learning experts in the field.
